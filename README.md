# Reeves

Your AI assistant remembers everything about your life and handles the busywork.

Track family events, coordinate contractors, follow up with friends, manage side projects—never forget a detail.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dshanklin-bv/reeves.git ~/repos/reeves
cd ~/repos/reeves
npm run setup
```

Setup creates your private data directory and walks you through MCP configuration.

## Use It

Open Claude Code and talk naturally:

```
"Create a task to call the plumber about the kitchen sink"
"What's next?"
"Mark that done"
```

That's it.

## Why Reeves?

**For power users only.** If you tinker with Claude Code and MCP servers, Reeves gives you a head start on building your own life management system.

**Intentionally not software.** Plain JSON files that AI reasons about. No Docker, no migrations, no buttons. Built for when AI manages your life through data.

**Real time savings:** 6+ hours/week managing 300+ tasks across house repairs, legal cases, family coordination, and side projects.

## Docs

Complete guides for tasks, projects, contacts, and scaling to SQLite when you outgrow JSON.

## Philosophy

- Data that AI reasons about, not UIs with buttons
- Learning logs for deep context, not bloated notes
- Start simple, migrate to databases only when needed
- Built for 2026-2027 when AI manages your life directly
