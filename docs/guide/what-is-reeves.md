# What is Reeves?

AI assistant for managing your life. Tasks, projects, contacts—all persistent across sessions.

## The Pattern

Traditional task managers: structure first, execute later.

Reeves: narrate naturally, let AI structure it.

You talk to Claude about what's happening. Reeves saves it. Forever.

## How It Works

You → Claude Code → Reeves MCP Server → JSON files

Next session: everything's still there.

## Why It Works

Reeves has just enough MCP tools to keep AI on task without restricting AI's adaptability to new situations.

Not a rigid workflow. Not a locked schema. Just structured persistence that AI can reason about.

## Core Concepts

**Tasks** - Things to do
**Projects** - Groups of related tasks
**Contacts** - How to communicate with people
**Learning Logs** - Deep context and history

## Why JSON Files?

- Open in any editor
- Fix mistakes directly
- See exactly what's stored
- Backup with file copy
- No Docker, no migrations

When you outgrow JSON (~300 tasks), migrate to SQLite. Most people never need to.

## Who Is This For?

People juggling:
- Family coordination
- House projects
- Legal matters
- Side businesses
- Relationships

Power users who tinker with Claude Code and MCP servers.

## What This Isn't

- Not a team tool (deeply personal)
- Not a calendar (task-focused)
- Not a CRM (for your life, not business)
- Not finished software (starting point you customize)
